xk6-dashboard `v0.8.0` is here 🎉!

This is a significant architectural release that improves the project structure and maintainability.

## New Features

### Frontend Assets Extraction

The frontend assets (UI, report, model, view, and config packages) have been extracted to a separate repository. This change:

- Reduces the main repository size by ~7,000 lines of code
- Removes Node.js/yarn toolchain requirements for backend development
- Enables independent versioning and release cycles for frontend and backend
- Maintains the same user experience and functionality

**Impact:** This change is transparent to end users. The extension continues to work exactly as before, with all frontend assets embedded in the binary at build time.

### Improved Project Architecture

- **Separation of Concerns**: Frontend and backend development can now be managed independently
- **Simplified Development Workflow**: Backend developers no longer need Node.js tooling installed
- **Pre-built Assets**: Frontend assets are pre-built and distributed as a Go module
- **Better Build Process**: Streamlined build pipeline with reduced complexity
